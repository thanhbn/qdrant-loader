# What is QDrant Loader?

QDrant Loader is a comprehensive toolkit that bridges the gap between your scattered technical content and AI-powered development tools. It collects, processes, and makes your documentation, code, and knowledge base searchable through intelligent AI assistants.

## 🎯 The Problem We Solve

**Have you ever experienced this?**

- 📚 Your team's knowledge is scattered across Git repositories, Confluence pages, JIRA tickets, and local files
- 🔍 Finding relevant information takes forever, even when you know it exists
- 🤖 AI coding assistants can't access your internal documentation and context
- 📝 Onboarding new team members is slow because information is hard to discover
- 🔄 You're constantly switching between tools to find the context you need

**QDrant Loader solves these problems** by creating a unified, searchable knowledge base that integrates directly with your AI development workflow.

## 🚀 How It Works

QDrant Loader consists of two main components working together:

### 1. 🔄 Data Ingestion Engine

The **QDrant Loader** package collects and processes content from multiple sources:

```text
Your Content Sources → QDrant Loader → Vector Database
├── Git repositories ├── File conversion ├── Searchable vectors
├── Confluence pages ├── Smart chunking ├── Metadata extraction
├── JIRA tickets ├── Change detection ├── Incremental updates
├── Documentation sites └── Embedding creation └── Optimized storage
└── Local files
```

### 2. 🔌 AI Integration Layer

The **MCP Server** provides intelligent search capabilities to AI development tools:

```text
AI Development Tools ← MCP Server ← Vector Database
├── Cursor IDE ├── Semantic search ├── Your processed content
├── Windsurf ├── Hierarchy-aware ├── Rich metadata
├── GitHub Copilot ├── Attachment-focused ├── Relationship mapping
└── Claude Desktop └── Real-time responses └── Context preservation
```
